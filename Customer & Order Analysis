#In this SQL, I have queried a database with mulitple tables in it to gain more insights about this company's customer base and the items they order. The database was provided to me by Charlotte Chaze in the Break Into Tech Data Analysis Certificate Program. The prompts listed below were provided by her. The SQL code generated below each prompt was written by me and is my own work.

--How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';
--Upon my first look at the data, I found that the information in the orderID column is messy, so I needed to filter it. Including the filter, this query indicates 9,681 orders were placed in January. 

--How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND Product = 'iPhone';
--379 of the orders placed in January were for an iPhone.

--Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. I know that the FebSales table has the orderID, but not the customer account numbers. I need to join the customer table in order to find that information.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM customers
INNER JOIN FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderID)= 6
and orderid <> 'Order ID';
--This resulted in 11,986 unique observations.

WHERE FebSales.Quantity > 2
AND length(order_id) = 6
